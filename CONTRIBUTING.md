# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Kirby MCP.

## Quick Start

- Open or comment on an issue for significant changes.
- Fork the repo and create a topic branch from `main`.
- Install dependencies: `composer install` and `npm ci`.
- Run tests: `composer test` (use `composer analyse` for static analysis).
- Format code: `composer format` and `npm run format`.

If integration tests require a Kirby fixture, run `composer cms:plainkit` first.

## Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused and describe the why and the how.
- Update docs/tests when behavior changes.
- Follow repo guidelines in `AGENTS.md`.

## Code of Conduct

Be kind and constructive in issues, reviews, and discussions.
